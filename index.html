	<p>My name is Hasan Mustafa. I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, although I barely remember any of the time I spent there. After spending some time in Houston, Texas, my family moved to their native country Pakistan when I was 4. Till the age of 22, I spent my life there. Growing up in Pakistan was a blast. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and many aspects of my personality come from spending so much time there. At the age of 22 I moved to America and that has been an experience of its own. The difference between the two countries is the pace of life. In Pakistan, it is much slower and you seem to have much more time. However, it is not as fruitful as America. In America, life is much faster and comes at you very fast, but it is more fruitful than what it is in Pakistan. I suppose each has its own balance.

		I love to code. It is something I have been very passionate about since I was introduced to it. When I was younger I loved computers. I remember using MS-DOS extensively to access computer games, files and other directories when I was younger. Unfortunately, my parents limited my time on the computer when I was younger and that pushed me towards liking other things. I would've loved to have started coding at a much younger age like many other people but it wasn't to be. However, everything in life comes to you when it is supposed to and I can only be thankful that I am coding now. This is my first real webpage and I am very excited to create it!
